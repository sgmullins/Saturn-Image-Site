# Saturn-Image-Site
This is a site I built using CSS-Grid and a few different versions of a JS file to populate the grid with random images from the img folder.

The inspiration and large portion of the code came from Wes Bos' CSS grid class found at <a href="https://cssgrid.io/">https://cssgrid.io/</a>.

I added a few different version of the JS file. They can be commented out and in as needed.
Mostly they change the way the grid is populated. I did not like the repeating images and short of adding many many images the non-random.js seemed like a decent comprimise.
I would like to experiment more with a better way to randomize numbers with no repeats, possible a fisher-yates shuffle.
